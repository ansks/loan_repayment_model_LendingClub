# loan repayment model for Lending Club using Tensorflow and Keras API

In this repository, I am submitting an end to end exercise of model building. Following steps have been performed in this exercise. 

1. Exploratory data analysis

2. Statistical analysis

3. Data pre-processing  
   a. Missing data imputation
   b. Categorical to numeric conversion

4. Model Building 

5. Model Evaluation

Again this is not the complete recipe. But, it can work as a template for starters. There are numerous methods in each section.
